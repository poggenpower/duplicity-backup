# See notes above within the 'dest' section.
directories:
  # Here are some examples:
  - Code
  - Documents/ebooks # example of sub-directory
  - Documents/taxes # example of sub-directory
  - Movies
  - Music
  - Pictures
  - "Shows/Ergo Proxy" # example with space
  - "Shows/My Hero Academia" # example with space

  # Forward-slashes ("/") are treated like paths.
  # This means you can, for example, backup only a subdirectory.
  # The parent directory structure will be created in
  # case you add subdirectories of the same parent structure later.
